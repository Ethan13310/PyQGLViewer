This project requires a recent version of SIP (tested with 4.5.2 and 4.6), Qt4 and PyQt4.

First, you need build a customized version of
libQGLViewer. For this download a version of the sources:
http://artis.imag.fr/~Gilles.Debunne/QGLViewer/download.html
for linux, archive is:
http://artis.imag.fr/Members/Gilles.Debunne/QGLViewer/src/libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1.tar.gz
and for windows
http://artis.imag.fr/Members/Gilles.Debunne/QGLViewer/src/libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1.zip

Unzip the archive on your disk. For instance
> tar xvzf libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1.tar.gz

A directory libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1 should be created

The patch file libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1-py.patch can been found in PyQGLViewer/src dir. 

For info, it has been build with the following command
> diff -abur libQGLViewer-2.2.5.1 libQGLViewer-2.2.5.1-py > libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1-py.patch

To apply this patch , you should invoke the command
> patch -p 0 < libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1-py.patch

Source are now ready to compile. Instr
Go into libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1/QGLViewer dir
> qmake-qt4 QGLViewer.pro
> make (or nmake)
> make install (you should be root on linux)
On windows to install the lib you should copy the QGLViewer225.dll
in library repository such as C:\WINDOWS\system32

To have designer plugin, you should go to libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1/designerPlugin
and invoke similar command
> qmake-qt4 designerPlugin.pro
> make (or nmake)
> make install (you should be root on linux)

libQGLViewer is now compiled and usable. Python wrapper can be build.
For this, you should simply do the following command
> python configure.py 
You should be root on linux to make it work. You can specify the 
source repository of libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1 with -Q option.
For instance 
> python configure.py -Q ../libQGLViewer-2.2.5-1
Then you simply have to compile and install with
> make (or nmake)
> make install (or nmake install, you should be root)

You can then test the new module with all examples
that you can find in the directory PyQGLViewer/examples.

Good luck,
